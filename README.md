The game 'Busy Buzzing' involves around a bee, **Bumbo**

The game follows his attempt to make it through the *rainforest* without harming himself.

A regular incoming of *pipes* from the top and bottom, with unpredictable gaps is Bumbo's nightmare which he must survive!

**Are you upto the challenge?**

How many pipes can you conquer before Bumbo hits his head and falls crashing down?

Don't fret too much. With some delightful *puns* added to make your game play more enjoyable, 

losing won't be as bad as you think!
